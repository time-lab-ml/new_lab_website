TIME Lab is currently undergoing three key transitions:

Originally named Temporal Intelligence and Motion Extraction, forming the acronym TIME, it is now shifting in scope and focus.

First, it is transitioning from fundamental research toward aggregating applicable data and generating evolutionary insights.
Second, it is moving from a focus on action recognition and anomaly detection to broader video and scene understanding.
Third, it is expanding from analyzing motions perceivable by humans to capturing subtle and often imperceptible changes, such as particle shifts, seasonal transitions, or plant growth.

Furthermore, TIME is integrating its collective experiences—from ANU and Data61/CSIRO to now incorporating the expertise of Griffith and UNSW—as it approaches its next and more mature phase.

TIME is evolving from its original meaning into a new identity: Transformative Insights and Multi-faceted Evaluation, a direction that will be highlighted in our upcoming TIME 2025 workshop at WWW’25 in Sydney.

The acronym TIME now also represents our broader mission: Building AI that is Transparent, Inclusive, Measured, and Ethical.
-Transparent: Promotes openness, auditability, and builds trust.
-Inclusive: Reflects fairness, diversity, and efforts to mitigate bias.
-Measured: Emphasizes accountability, performance tracking, and quantifiable risk—crucial for both technical and policy impact.
-Ethical: Aligns directly with responsible AI principles and ethical frameworks.

A renewed version of the TIME Lab website is expected to launch around December 1, and it would be great if you could be part of it, TIME³.
