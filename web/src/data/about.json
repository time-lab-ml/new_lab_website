      "TIME Lab is currently undergoing a significant transformation. Originally named Temporal Intelligence and Motion Extraction, we are now shifting from fundamental research toward aggregating applicable data and generating evolutionary insights.",
      "We are expanding from action recognition and anomaly detection to broader video and scene understanding, and from analyzing human-perceivable motions to capturing subtle changes such as particle shifts, seasonal transitions, or plant growth.",
      "TIME now represents our broader mission: Building AI that is Transparent (promotes openness, auditability, and trust), Inclusive (reflects fairness, diversity, and bias mitigation), Measured (emphasizes accountability and quantifiable performance), and Ethical (aligns with responsible AI principles).",
      "Integrating collective experiences from ANU, Data61/CSIRO, Griffith, and UNSW, we are approaching our next and more mature phase—TIME³."
